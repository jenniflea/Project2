Project 2 Notes:
- Kind of like INK
- FPS, probably played with mouse and keyboard or XBox controller
- Everything in room is white/transparent (walls, floor, obstacles, enemies) except main door. Get to main door to complete level
- Player has paint gun, can shoot enemies, walls, floor, obstacles, etc to see surroundings (probably limited number of bullets)
- Running into transparent enemies can hurt you! Exposed parts of enemies won't hurt you (can use them to help you get to your goal!)...unless they're like spikes or something
- Enemies may leave trail behind or spots, etc. to give you hints to their location

Note:
- Camera should be able to be moved with mouse/left control stick, arrow keys/right control stick will move player. Shoot with X/A.

Enemies:
- Slow moving cubes with large trails
- Flying enemy that drops paint on you -- which apparently can hurt you. or can paint the floor!

(Future work)
Different Paint Guns:
- Normal/beginner gun
- idk what other types of guns there are
